This is my laptop computer I bought myself when I was in about the 6th grade for sub $200 from ASUS. The trackpad on this computer is
broken so the design of this system is based around not having a mouse. The reason this system is made to be so light weight is so 
that I can run intensive applications while development. The majority of development being done on this system is C/C++ Game
Development which involves a lot of resources. Also having tons of chrome tabs open without feeling draged down if always a plus. 
Having a light-weight system can never hurt, especially if you love the feel of it.
